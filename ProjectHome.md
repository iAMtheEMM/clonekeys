CloneKeys duplicates (clones) incoming keystrokes and sends them to the applications as setup in the main CloneKeys configuration window.

This is mostly useful for multi-boxing in games. (Open up multiple copies of World of Warcraft and use CloneKeys to send the same keystrokes to multiple windows simultaneously.)

Currently tested with Mac OS X 10.5.6 on Intel (Version 0.2b).
Currently tested with Mac OS X 10.6.4 on Intel (Version 0.5).
Should work with previous versions of Mac OS X also.

Note: CloneKeys is Mac only. Windows users, you'll want to check out the excellent [keyclone](http://www.solidice.com/downloads/windows/keyclone) instead. (Keyclone inspired the creation of CloneKeys and I can't recommend it enough.)




Here is a short [Demo Movie](http://files.filefront.com/clonekeysmov/;8585768;/fileinfo.html) of CloneKeys in action.
