## Introduction ##

CloneKeys duplicates (clones) incoming keystrokes and sends them to the applications setup in the main CloneKeys configuration window.

This is mostly useful for multi-boxing in games. (Open up multiple copies of World of Warcraft and use CloneKeys to send the same keystrokes to multiple windows simultaneously.)

## Details ##

Basic instructions for use:

  1. Start up multiple copies of your favorite game. (Say **World of Warcraft**)
  1. Start up **CloneKeys**
  1. Click **Add** button in the **CloneKeys** toolbar.
    * Click a **World of Warcraft** game window
  1. Repeat step 3 as needed
  1. Play

## TODO ##

Possible improvements / plans for the future:

  * Cross-machine sending. Cross-compatiable with keyclone? Discuss with keyclone author.
  * Addition of keymaps? Not sure they are necessary, since creative key binding / unbinding in WoW usually accomplishes the same thing.
  * Integrated xkeys support... xkeys support on the Mac is decidedly blah, so integrating support directly into CloneKeys might be a good thing.
